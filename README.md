# Dataset Description
_Original dataset [found here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/jellyfish-types)_

This dataset contains 900 images of jellyfish belonging to six different categories and species: mauve stinger jellyfish, moon jellyfish, barrel jellyfish, blue jellyfish, compass jellyfish, and lion’s mane jellyfish. You can apply ML techniques to gain insights into jellyfish classification, species identification, and color analysis.

1. **Moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita)**: Common jellyfish with four horseshoe-shaped gonads visible through the top of its translucent bell. It feeds by collecting medusae, plankton, and mollusks with its tentacles.
2. **Barrel jellyfish (Rhizostoma pulmo)**: Largest jellyfish found in British waters, with a bell that can grow up to 90 cm in diameter. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.
3. **Blue jellyfish (Cyanea lamarckii)**: Large jellyfish that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.
4. **Compass jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella)**: Named after the brown markings on its bell that resemble a compass rose. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.
5. **Lion’s mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata)**: Largest jellyfish in the world, with a bell that can grow up to 2 meters in diameter and tentacles that can reach up to 30 meters in length. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.
6. **Mauve stinger (Pelagia noctiluca)**: Small jellyfish with long tentacles and warty structures on its bell full of stinging cells. It feeds on other small jellyfish and oceanic sea squirts.
